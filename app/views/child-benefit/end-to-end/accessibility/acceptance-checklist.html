    Accessibility acceptance checklist
  </h1>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    General accessibility acceptance criteria
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body-l">
    All screens that contain content should:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Have text with a colour contrast of at least 4.5:1 (Normal-sized text up to 23px/18px
      bold).</li>
    <li>Not depend on colour alone to communicate information.</li>
    <li>Icons with a contrast ratio of 3.0:1 and non-text elements and borders. Images used
      for decorative purposes are set as background images, preferably (CSS). Images can
      be marked as with a presentation role when they are not needed for information. See
      "Using images."</li>
    <li>Allow users to change their colour preferences (high contrast black and white) without
      loss of content.</li>
    <li>Announce any changes to all users. For example, hide and display content for screen
      readers and sighted users when necessary.</li>
    <li>When new content appears and is after the current point of focus, consider
      setting an alert, status or polite role. The instruction in the new content is enough
      for an AT user to realise they need to navigate forward. A status message when
      something is removed is to help them rearrange their cognitive map of the
      screen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    Accessibility acceptance criteria for headings
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body-l">
    All headings should:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Convey the level so screen reader users can jump through the list of headings to the
      content they're looking for.
    </li>  
    <li>Be nested in a way that makes sense to users. See the section on Headings and
      Labels.
    </li>  
    <li>Allow users to navigate by headings.</li>
      <li>Use the caption element to provide a title for the table.</li>

  </ul>




  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    Accessibility acceptance criteria for interactive elements (elements that users can focus on)
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body-l">
    Make sure screens are operable with the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a keyboard (use native HTML form elements)
    </li>  
    <li>two essentials of a good experience are the ability to discern the location of the
      keyboard focus easily and to discover where the focus landed after an interaction
    </li>  
    <li>a mouse</li>
    <li>screen reader in focus or form mode</li>
    <li>screen reader shortcuts</li>
    <li>voice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some screen readers depend on the user understanding guidance behind specific
interactions. For example, Dragon users will have to say actual keyboard commands, e.g.
"press the delete key".
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body-l">
    To make sure users can operate interactive elements, those elements should:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Indicate when content is expanded or collapsed</li>  
    <li>Be large enough to tap with one finger</li>  
    <li>Change appearance when focused. For example, links and form elements have
      defined focus indicators (yellow and thick black border)</li>
    <li>Change appearance when users hover their mouse over them (see focus indicators)</li>
    <li>Not trap focus in a loop from which users cannot exit</li>
    <li>Not assume that title attribute tooltips are accessible for all users</li>
    <li>Identify links that open in a new tab or window.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Accessibility acceptance criteria for form elements
</h2>
<p class="govuk-body-l">
  All form elements should:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Show a message if the form has mandatory fields that must be completed</li>  
  <li>Have a perceivable text label</li>  
  <li>Associate labels and instructions with inputs</li>
  <li>If appropriate, use the fieldset to group related form fields</li>
  <li>Show an error message. See Forms and Form errors</li>
 
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Accessibility acceptance criteria for layout
</h2>
<p class="govuk-body-l">
  To allow users to make adjustments on their device, screens should work when:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Users enlarge the text</li>  
  <li>Users zoom to 400%</li>  
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Additional information on the acceptance criteria
</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Colour
</h3>

<p>(1.4.3 CONTRAST, 1.4.11 NON TEXT CONTRAST, 1.4.1 USE OF COLOR)</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Check the contrast for all text. Normal-sized text (Up to 23px/18px bold) should have
    a contrast ratio of 4.5:1</li>  
  <li>Check the contrast for non-text elements, like icons, borders, etc. These should have
    a contrast ratio of 3.0:1</li>  
  <li>Check your content in Accessibility Display Modes. Activate modes such as Windows
    High Contrast to check the overall contrast and legibility of page elements like icons,
    borders, links, etc.</li>
  <li>Check the contrast for all normal-sized text</li>
  <li>Check the contrast for all large-sized text</li>
  <li>Check the contrast for all icons</li>
  <li>Check the contrast of borders for input elements (text input, radio buttons,
    checkboxes, etc.)</li>
 </ul>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Layout
</h3>

<p>(1.4.10 REFLOW)</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Ensure the content can be viewed without distortion when orientated to a horizontal view or zoomed in for easier reading. Design for responsiveness to accommodate a view or zoomed in for easier reading. Design for responsiveness to accommodate a clean viewpoint at all zoom levels. When a person zooms in to over 300% (using
    either the mobile operating system or the browser settings), the layout should reflow into one column to allow them to view content easily and not have to scroll sideways to read.
  </li>
  <li>There should be no two-dimensional scrolling (vertical and horizontal). There are scenarios when two-dimensional scrolling is okay, for instance, on a table or an image
    in which meaning is lost without the two dimensions.</li>
  <li>Ensure that viewport zoom is not disabled</li>
 </ul>



 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Headings
</h3>

<p>(2.4.6 HEADINGS OR LABELS)</p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Every page should have at least one heading. Modals do not have to have an H1, but it
    is recommended they do. Screen readers should announce the text content of
    elements, such as headings.</li>
  <li>Use only one H1 element per page or view.</li>
  <li>Keep headings in a complete and logical order from the top of the page. For example,
    an h3 element should not appear on a page before the first h2 element. And don't
    jump headings, skipping from an h1 to an h3 element without an h2 in between.</li>
    <li>The table's caption should describe the information the table contains.</li>
    <li>Screen readers should announce HTML elements such as buttons and headings - for
      example, and they should announce a button as a button, an h2 as a heading level 2,
      and so on.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Interactive elements and their instructions
</h3>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>For interactive components, check if the screen reader gives users instructions on
    how to interact with them - for example, "To activate, press Enter" if this is the native
    behaviour of the screen reader for that particular element.</li>
  <li>Check if users get feedback about any changes to the state of the element - for
    example if the element expands or collapses</li>
 
 </ul>


 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Forms and Form errors
</h3>

<p>(3.3.1 ERROR IDENTIFICATION)</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Display input error messages above a form and relate them to the specific fields</li>
  <li>Use the appropriate colour styling for summary errors</li>
  <li>All inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding label element</li>
  <li>Associate input error messaging with the input it corresponds to</li>
  <li>Make sure that error, warning, and success states are not visually communicated by
    just colour</li>
 
 </ul>


 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Using Images
</h3>

<p>(1.1.1 NON-TEXT CONTENT)</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Ensure all eligible images have descriptive text (‘alt’ text) so their meaning in
    context can be communicated via other forms, such as large print, braille, and speech.</li>
  <li>For decorative images — you don’t need to supply an alt copy (define ‘null’ instead)</li>
 </ul>

 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Global
</h3>

<p>(4.1.2 Landmark Name, Role and Vlaue)</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Use landmark elements to indicate important content regions if appropriate.</li>
 </ul>
