# Pega Prototyping Experiment
 
 A demo to see how we can prototype with Pega's constellation design system
 Uses vite to compile React, index.html contains the shell for the SPA

 NOTES:

 - [ ] SPA by default, do we implement a router for prototyping? Make it easy to configure.
 - [ ] If it proves to be a success, do we try to make it like GDS?
