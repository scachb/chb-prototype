# Pega Prototyping Experiment

A demo to see how we can prototype with Pega's constellation design system
Uses vite to compile React, index.html contains the shell for the SPA

TODOS:

- [ ] Update with proper HMRC branded colours and logo svg/png
- [ ] Chat with Ian/Peter about the idea of this for myself and Alex.
- [ ] Attempt to recreate AUI
- [ ] Attempt to recreate Child benefits process page
- [ ] Bring in Theme Cosmos/UI Kit for co-existence prototypes
- [ ] Abstract away app shell, with props to customise for future projects

CONSIDERATIONS:

- [ ] SPA by default, do we implement a router for prototyping? Make it easy to configure.
- [ ] If it proves to be a success, do we try to make it like GDS?
- [ ] What do we do about onboarding?
- [ ] Do we publish as an npm package i.e. "hmrc-pega-prototype-kit"?
- [ ] Prettier extension to avoid manually formatting react code
